# Hey, I'm Keegen 👋  

**Product & Growth Strategy | Builder with AI Chops**  

I help startups move faster, think clearer, and build with heart.  
Most of my work lives where product strategy, growth mechanics, and AI meet.  

I like to get my hands dirty testing ideas, building quick loops, and using AI to make teams smarter and faster.

### ⚙️ What I’m Building

🚀 **Grindwell.ai** — my current side project, focused on building AI-powered systems that help junior golfers develop skills and a mindset to succeed.  
🧠 **AI-driven growth tools** — connecting product signals, user feedback, and business metrics to drive smarter decisions.  
📈 **Product frameworks in motion** — fast iterations on onboarding, activation, and retention loops.  
🏗 **Internal prototypes** — tiny scrappy tools that remove friction in product ops and testing.
